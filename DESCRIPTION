Description: The biodbKegg library is an extension of the biodb framework
    package that provides access to the KEGG databases Compound, Enzyme, Genes,
    Module, Orthology and Reaction. It allows to retrieve entries by their
    accession numbers. Web services like "find", "list" and "findExactMass" are
    also available. Some functions for navigating along the pathways have also
    been implemented.
